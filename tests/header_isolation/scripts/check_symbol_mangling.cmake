# check_symbol_mangling.cmake
#
# Run as a `cmake -P` script from the CTest target
# `amio_symbol_mangling`.  Verifies R10.5, R10.8 by inspecting the
# dynamic symbol table of libamio.so:
#
#     nm -D --defined-only libamio.so
#
# The check rule (from design.md "Header isolation enforcement"):
#
#     nm -D libamio.so | grep ' T '            \\\
#                      | grep -v '^[0-9a-f]* T amio_'
#
# must produce zero lines.  Equivalently: every globally-exported
# text-segment symbol in libamio.so MUST begin with the `amio_`
# prefix and MUST NOT carry C++ name mangling (`_Z...`, `__Z...`,
# vague-linkage helpers, etc.).
#
# When `nm` is unavailable on the host, the test exits 77 so CTest
# reports it as SKIPPED instead of failing -- CI always provides
# `nm`, so the gate is preserved on PRs.
#
# Required CMake variables (set by the parent test):
#   AMIO_NM_EXECUTABLE   absolute path to nm, or empty when missing
#   AMIO_LIBRARY_FILE    absolute path to the freshly-built libamio
#                        (resolved from $<TARGET_FILE:amio_core> at
#                        test invocation time)
